 <h1> Overwatch 2 Types of Maps and How to Play Them</h1>   
    

<p> Overwatch 2 or OW2 for short is an FPS game that has a variety of different types of maps to play on. And each type of map is played differently than the other. In this article I will talk about all the 5 types of maps that you will experience often when playing OW2. Also all these tips apply to only Unranked modes for the most part as the Competetive Rules for maps are more complicated than what can be explained here. </p>
    

    <p> Here is a brief list of the types of Maps in OW2 and what they are called. These are, </p>
    
        <ol> 
            <li> Escort</li>
            <li>  Control</li>
            <li> Hybrid</li>
            <li> Push</li>
            <li> Flashpoint</li>
                        </ol>

    <h2>  Escort </h2>
    
    <h3> Brief Overview and rules</h3>
    
        <p> Escort is a Map type which involves pushing and defending a payload which is a vehicle that must be escorted to the end.</p>
    
        <p>In this map, there are two teams of 5. The attackers are responsible for delivering the "payload" on time and the defenders are responsible for stopping the attackers from escorting the payload on time.</p>
    
        <p> Throughout a match on this map type, the payload has to go through 3 checkpoints. And everytime the payload gets escorted to a checkpoint by the attackers, their time gets increased. However, after they cross the second checkpoint on the map, they will no longer get time extensions as the attackers either escort the payload on time to the last checkpoint and win the match, or the defenders reduce the attacker's time and win the match.  </p>
    
        <p> To move the payload, the attackers only have to be very close to the payload or be touching it. However, if a defender gets close to the payload, the payload will stop moving. This is called contesting the payload. </p>
    
<h3> Tips for Escort</h3>  
    <p> When playing on this map type, you will find that the more attackers are on the payload, the faster it goes. However, many pro gamers in OW2 recommend that some attackers are escorting the payload, while the rest of the attackers go further ahead of payload and try to stop the defenders early. </p>
    
    <p> For defenders, often times, if there's enough time, it's often better to either attack the attackers as a team or give distance from attackers on paylaod and do damage from a distance to build up ultimates to potentially do a big stop on them.</p>
    <p> Additionally, if either the Attackers or Defenders are on the payload, it is advised against throwing yourself onto the objective by yourself as this can lead to bad outcomes. Instead, it is advised to work with your team to attack the other team as once, as teamed attacks often become more successful.</p>
    
<h3> Overtime rules</h3>
    <p> When the end of the match is near the end and the time is going down, if the attackers touch the payload between 3-0 seconds, the game will go into overtime. In this situation, the attackers can escort the payload even further and potentially take the win or they die and overtime will be over and thus defenders will win </p>

<h2> Control </h2>
<h3> Brief overview and rules</h3>
    <p> Control or sometimes called "King of the Hill" involves capturing an objective and conquering it to the max to win the round.</p>
    
    <p> In this map, there are also two teams of 5. But in this map, both teams have the same objetive which is conqure the objective to its max. </p>
    <p> In this map, there are actually multiple "mini maps" and rounds which involve capturing individual own objectives. To win, the winning team must attack at least 2 objectives to win.   </p>
    <p> When playing on this map, the team has to capture th  the objective and get conquered to 100% before the other team does. The team who does this first wings the round. </p>
    <P> Additionally, it is best out of 3 rounds, so if one team successfuly conquers the first objective and sucessfuly captures the second objective, they will win the match and the match will not go to the third round</P>
    <p> However if the team does not successfully capture the second objective, then the 3rd round will be initiated and whoever captures the 3rd objective and conquers in to 100% wins the match</p>
    
<h3> Tips for Playing</h3>
    
    <p> On this map, it is often worth the effort to try to get to the objectives first, as typically the team that gets the objective first, typically has better odds of conquering it to 100%. </p>
   
    <p> When captured the objective as a team, it is also important to keep strong defenses and having good game sense to predict where the team could attack the objective from, as many maps have different paths to the objective</p>
    
    <p> On similar note, if the other team has succesfully attacked the objective and are conquering it, it can often be a bad idea to attack the objective from the "main path" as the enemy team already has strong defenses for that path. Instead it is often better to go an alternate route that can catch the enemy team by surprise in better chances</p>
    
<h3> Overtime Rules</h3>
    <p> If anyone from the opposing team attacks the objective between 95% and 99%, the game will go into overtime.</p>
    <P> If the attacking team succesffuly eliminates the team on the objective, they can conquer the objective and win. However, if the enemy team eliminates the attackers, the overtime will be over and the round or match will be lost</P>

<h2> Hybrid</h2>

    <h3> Overview and Rules</h3>
    <p> Hybrid maps involve attacking and objective and then escorting a payload to win the match</p>
    <p> In this map, there are also two teams of 5 and the rules are almost the same as Escort maps, with slight adjustments </p>
    <p> Here, the attackers are responsible for capturing the objective and escorting the payload to the end and on time. The defenders are respnsible for stopping the attackers for doing so </p>
    <p> The first thing to capture on the map, as mentioned above is the objective. The objective has 3 "ticks" and each of these ticks must be captured for the objective to be captured.</p>
    <p> Keep in mind, that if any defender is on the objective, during the capturing process, the capturing will stop</p>
    <p> After capturing the objective, the attacking team instead has to escort the payload to two checkpoints. Going to the first checkpoint increases the time, but after this, no more time extensions are provided. This is because if the attackers escort the payload to the last checkpoint they win the match, however if the defenders stop them, they win the match </p>
    
    <h3> Tips for Playing Map</h3>
    <p> For capturing objectives in this map type, there are these paths called "Chockpoints. These are paths that attackers must take to get to the objective and there are no alternate paths. </p>
    <p> It is a good idea to keep this in mine when playing these maps, as these checkpoints can cause major setbacks in teamfights.</p>

    <h3> Overtime Rules</h3>
   <p> When the end of the match is near the end and the time is going down, if the attackers touch the payload or objective between 3-0 seconds, the game will go into overtime. In this situation, the attackers can escort the payload even further and potentially take the win or they die and overtime will be over and thus defenders will win </p>

<h2> Push</h2>
    <h3> Overview and Rules</h3>
    <p> Push maps involve esorting a robot to cover and push a barrier as much distance as possible and to try to escort the robot to the end of the path to win the entire game</p>
    <p> In this map, there are also two teams of 5 and both teams have the same objective which is to escort the robot on their path to push the team's object the most distance.</p>
    <p> Each Push Map game starts with 8 minutes on the clock.</p>
    <p> During a match, after a robot has stopped pushing the barrier on either team, the distance it covered will be marked on the top screen and there will also be a mark representing where the robot has stopped pushing</p>
    <p> There are two ways to win a match in this map type. 
        <p>The first way is when a team pushes the robot and the barrier all the way to the end. However a team can also win by having the robot push the most distance during the match.</p> 
    <p>For example, if one Team escorted the robot 90 meters, while the other team only escorted 100 meters, then this team will win the match during "normal" ciricumstances </p>
    <h3> Tips to Play on this Map Type</h3>
    <p> Push Mode and Escort are very similiar in terms of playstyle, however there are some major differences</p>
    <p> Unlike in Escort, where the number of players on the payload determine how fast it goes, in Push, it doesn't matter how many players are next to the robot as it will continue to move at same speed regardless.</p>
    <p> So in this map type, it is even more important to have some players(ideally 2) and the rest go further beyond the robot and give early damage to the other team to increase the chances of getting further ahead</p>
    
    <p> Here's another thing to keep in mind. Let's say there is a Blue Team and a Red Team. The Blue Team has already escorted 120 meters for the robot but the Red Team has put up a good fight and stopped their push and are pushing the robot towards their barrier now. Because the robot is now farther away from the Red Team, the Red Team must put up even bigger teamfights to have better momentum to overtake the Blue Team in terms of Distance. This can be overwelming and requires a good amount of coordination but it can be done. </p>
    <p> Because of this, it's very important to try to use ablities and ultimates wisely as if you lose either one of these things(especially big impact and long cooldown abilities) it can make these types of fights harder to win. </p>
    <h3> Overtime Rules</h3>
    <p> When the time is getting low and the end of the match is near, if anyone from the opposing team goes near the robot, the game will go into Overtime</p>
    <p> Here's an example explaning how this works.</p>
    <p> Let's say the Blue Team has escorted the robot 121 meters and the match has 6 seconds left. But two people on the Red team go near the robot and stop the push which triggers the game into overtime. Because the game is now in overtime, the red team only has to escort robot's barrier beyond where it stopped. The red team does not have to escort the barrier to the end of their path anymore. However, the red team can experience a difficult task as the Blue Team may use powerful tactics to easily stop the Red Team's push. So it's important to be aware of this when playing a match on this map type.</p>

         <h2> FlashPoint</h2>
    <h3> Overview and Rules</h3>
    <p> FlashPoint is OW2's most recent map mode and the current mode has only two maps in it. </p>
    <p> In this map mode, there are two teams of 5 and the teams also have the same objective which is to fully conquer 3 objectives on the map</p>
    <p> Flashpoint and Control are both very similiar but they have their major differences</p>
    <p> Unlike Control, there are no rounds after each objective capture. This means, after you capture one objective your team has to walk to the next one in the same map. This means that Flashpoint maps are very big compared to other map types in this game</p>
    <p> There are total of 6 objectives on a Flashpoint map, and each team must attempt to fully control 3 objectives to win. </p>
    <p> Just like in Control Maps, a team must fully gain the objective to 100% to fully conquer it. If anyone from the enemy team goes onto the objective, then the progress will stop for your team and they'll begin their conquering process</p>
    <h3> Tips on How to play</h3>
    <p> In this map mode, just like in Control, typically the team that goes to an objective first and gets its conquering process started first, typically wins the objective.</p>
    <p> But if the team on the objective doesn't provide good defenses, then they could easily lose the objective to the enemy team.</p>
    <p> However, if the enemy team has already begun  the process og capturing an objective, it is unadvised to throw yourself on the objective by yourself, as it won't do much. Instead, many pros recommend, trying to attack an objective as a team, using the resources avaliable, such as abilities and ultimates in good manner.</p>
    <p> Doing these types fo attacks often lead to better success for attacking the objective.</p>
    <p> On a similar note, when defending a point, it can be a good idea to try to predict where the enemy will attack the objective from. This is because there can be multiple paths an enemy team can take to get to the objective. So being aware of this can be game saving. </p>
    
    <h3> Overtime Rules</h3>
    
    <p> Overtime Rules are pretty much the same as Control maps, in the sense that if anyone from the enemy team attacks an objective between 95% and 99%, the game will go into overtime. </p>
    <p>If the attacking team succesffuly eliminates the team on the objective, they can conquer the objective and win. However, if the enemy team eliminates the attackers, the overtime will be over and the round or match will be lost </p>
